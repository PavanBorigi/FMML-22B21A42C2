        "\n",
        "Utilizing the Entire Dataset: In k-fold cross-validation, you use the entire dataset for both training and validation, ensuring that all data points are used for assessment. This is particularly important when working with limited data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Tuning: Cross-validation is often used in the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process. It allows you to compare different models or hyperparameter settings more fairly by providing an average performance score across multiple validation sets.\n",
